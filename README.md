## General Information
- In skin cancer test, the dermatologist takes some part of the skin lesion and examines it under the microscope. The current process is manual and takes significant amount of time to arrive at a conclusion of the biopsy test. The main aim is to reduce this time of examination to help patients and doctors. The approach uses Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify nine types of skin cancer from outlier lesions images.
